### Installation Guide:

* this application is set up to only work with MacOS 14.4+
    * if you're on a lower MacOS, email me: brodsky.alex22@gmail.com, and I'll try to have it work with lower versions

* download the zip from [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m8X2TRyfuec3BwHg0ln5yIVTkW53AYCk?usp=sharing)

* unzip it

* move it to the applications folder

* open it and you will get a pop up saying Apple can't open it because its from an unidentified developer

* click 'open anyway'

* for universal paste without formatting (cmd + shift + v):

    * this is turned off by default, but can be turned on in the app's settings

    * when you try to paste with (cmd + shift + v):

    * you can also click the plus and add the app manually

    * I know, its a lil scary because it says 'control your computer', but its just because it needs to listen to (cmd + shift + v) to paste without formatting.
        * again, you can turn this off in the settings
