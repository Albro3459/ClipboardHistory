    * also click the menu bar icon to show the app

    * scroll arrow button, cmd + up/down arrow, or page up/down to scroll up or down

* double-click, enter, or copy button to copy an item/group

* delete button or cmd + delete to delete an item/group

* expand button or right-arrow when selecting group to expand

* expand button or left-arrow on group to contract

* cmd + f to search

* escape takes you out of search or selecting clipboard types

* option + r resets the window size and shows it

* cmd + shift + v for paste without formatting anywhere on your computer!

* the open button next to files and folders opens the file or folder

### Installation Guide:

* download the zip from [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m8X2TRyfuec3BwHg0ln5yIVTkW53AYCk?usp=sharing)

* unzip it

* move it to the applications folder

* open it and you will get a pop up saying Apple can't open it because its from an unidentified developer and it can't be scanned for viruses

* click ok

* open settings > privacy & security, then scroll down to security and allow the app to open

* pretty much done, unless you want to use paste without formatting (cmd + shift + v)

    * then in settings >  privacy & security > accessibility, flip the switch next to the clipboard history app

        * if it hasn't shown up yet, then when the app is running, copy something and paste using (cmd + shift + v) and you should get a popup saying you need to allow it in accessibility
